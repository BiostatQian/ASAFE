  "body": "## What is ASAFE?\r\n\r\nThe ASAFE EM algorithm provides maximum likelihood estimates of ancestry-specific allele frequencies at a bi-allelic marker, given local ancestries and genotypes at the marker. It deals with uncertainty in the phase (i.e. order) of a local ancestry pair relative to a genotype. \r\n\r\nHere is a picture illustrating how ASAFE fits into a genetic analysis workflow: \r\n[Picture of a Workflow using ASAFE](https://github.com/BiostatQian/ASAFE/raw/73138e4cc5ee53f4a43a7784e285b18d8dd28a38/ASAFE_Visual.pdf)\r\n\r\nASAFE was motivated by genome-wide association studies of Hispanics performed by the University of Washington Genetic Analysis Center as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study (https://www2.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/), and applies to any 3-way admixed diploid population, not just humans.\r\n\r\n## Paper Reference\r\n\r\nZhang QS, Browning BL, and Browning SR (2016) “Ancestry Specific Allele Frequency Estimation.” Bioinformatics.\r\n\r\n## How to Use the ASAFE R Package\r\n\r\nIn the ASAFE R package folder, see vignettes/ASAFE.pdf for instructions on how to use the package.
