ASAFE provides maximum likelihood estimates of ancestry-specific allele frequencies at a bi-allelic marker, given local ancestries and genotypes at the marker. It deals with uncertainty in the phase (i.e. order) of a local ancestry pair relative to a genotype. \r\n\r\nHere is a picture illustrating how ASAFE fits into a genetic analysis workflow: ![Picture of a Workflow using ASAFE.](https://github.com/BiostatQian/ASAFE/raw/73138e4cc5ee53f4a43a7784e285b18d8dd28a38/ASAFE_Visual.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis website distributes the ASAFE R package that implements the ASAFE EM algorithm discussed in this paper:\r\n\r\nZhang QS, Browning BL, and Browning SR (2016) “Ancestry Specific Allele Frequency Estimation.” Bioinformatics.\r\n\r\nIn the ASAFE R package folder, see vignettes/ASAFE.pdf for instructions on how to use the R package.
