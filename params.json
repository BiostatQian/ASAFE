  "body": "## What is ASAFE?\r\n\r\nThe ASAFE EM algorithm provides maximum likelihood estimates of ancestry-specific allele frequencies at a bi-allelic marker, given local ancestries and genotypes at the marker. It deals with uncertainty in the phase (i.e. order) of a local ancestry pair relative to a genotype. \r\n\r\nASAFE was motivated by genome-wide association studies of Hispanics performed by the University of Washington Genetic Analysis Center as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study (https://www2.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/), and applies to any 3-way admixed diploid population, not just humans.\r\n\r\n## Picture Showing How ASAFE Fits Into a Genetic Analysis Workflow\r\n\r\nIn the top folder of the ASAFE R package is a file, ASAFE_Visual.pdf, illustrating how ASAFE fits into a genetic analysis workflow: \r\n\r\n[Picture of a Workflow using ASAFE](https://github.com/BiostatQian/ASAFE/raw/master/vignettes/ASAFE_Visual.pdf)\r\n\r\nSharon Browning has some code that does the steps in the diagram involving phasing of genotypes and running of RFMIX.\r\nIt is the part of the following script above the line that says \"Apply masking\": http://faculty.washington.edu/sguy/local_ancestry_pipeline/rfmix_mds_pipeline.\r\nI've extracted the relevant part of the script here: \r\n\r\n[BEAGLE to phase genotypes and then RFMIX to get local ancestries and re-phased genotypes on admixed sample](https://github.com/BiostatQian/ASAFE/raw/master/inst/scripts/bgl_then_rfmix.sh)\r\n\r\n## How to Use the ASAFE R Package\r\n\r\nIn the ASAFE R package folder, see vignettes/ASAFE.pdf for instructions on how to use the package.
