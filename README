(1) See the webpage http://biostatqian.github.io/ASAFE/ for an introduction to this repos.

(2) See the vignette inst/doc/ASAFE.pdf for instructions on how to use the package.

(3) A smaller version of this package is on Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/ASAFE/.

The Bioconductor package is smaller than the GitHub package here, because the Bioconductor version does not have a Reproducibility section in the vignette, or Reproducibility-associated functions, data sets, and functions' man pages.

The folder of R code and folder of unit tests in this GitHub version should be exactly the same as the Bioconductor version's folders, as you can check with this command in a Linux shell:

diff --brief -r dir1/ dir2/

where dir1 and dir2 are folder names, e.g. dir1 could be the Bioconductor version's R folder and dir2 could be this GitHub version's R folder.
