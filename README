See the webpage http://biostatqian.github.io/ASAFE/ for an introduction to this repos.

A smaller version of this package has been *accepted* for inclusion in Bioconductor. I am currently going through final procedures to get it on there, hopefully in the coming days. (Sorry, at International Biometric Conference, I mistakenly said the package was already there.)

The Bioconductor package is smaller than the GitHub package here, because the Bioconductor version does not have a Reproducibility section in the vignette, or Reproducibility-associated functions, data sets, and functions' man pages.

The folder of R code and folder of unit tests in this GitHub version should be exactly the same as the Bioconductor version's folders, as you can check with this command in a Linux shell:

diff --brief -r dir1/ dir2/

where dir1 and dir2 are folder names, e.g. dir1 could be the Bioconductor version's R folder and dir2 could be this GitHub version's R folder.
